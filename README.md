# FizzBuzz

This project is a Scala implementation of FizzBuzz kata.  
It uses ScalaTest library to make tests run.

## Rules

The point is to work with TDD to create a tested function taking an `Int`
and returning a `String` according to following rules :
- Input is multiple of 3, "fizz" should be returned
- Input is multiple of 5, "buzz" should be returned
- Input is multiple of 3 & 5, "fizzbuzz" should be returned
- Input is not multiple of 3 or 5, input should be returned unchanged as a string

## Refucktoring

This project was created in order to do refucktoring workshop.  
The point is to make the code as dirty and unreadable as possible without breaking any tests.

To do so, you can change as much as you want `FizzBuzz.scala` file,
but you can't change `FizzBuzzTest.scala`.
